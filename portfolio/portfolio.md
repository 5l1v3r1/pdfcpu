# Portfolio

Manage a PDF portfolio.

Use PDF as a portfolio container for any kind of files aka portfolio entries.
Add portfolio entries, list them, extract or remove by filename.

Usually a PDF portfolio is comprised of a cover page (the PDF file) plus a couple of
file attachments which get presented as entries in a portfolio collection by Adobe Reader.
