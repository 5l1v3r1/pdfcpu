# About

Document interchange is essential in the world we live in. PDF is everywhere and it is not going away anytime soon.

This is an effort to build a PDF processing library from the ground up written in Go with strong support for batch processing via a rich command line.

Over time `pdfcpu` aims to support the standard range of PDF processing features and also any interesting use cases that may present themselves along the way.
